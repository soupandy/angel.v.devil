# Angel.V.Devil

### An android game for kids

Angel.V.Devil is a chase/maze game.
Players play a lost angel looking for the way out of a hellish maze.
At the maze exit an _evil_ devil lurks.
If the two meet our poor angel is doomed, as he is no match for the devils _poking_ trident.
_Unless..._
Somewhere in the maze there is a hammer the angel can pick up to _bong_ the mischievous devil and dizzy him for a while.
But wait... the devil is not all our heroic angel has to deal with:
The sneaky devil has installed a devilish field at the maze exit that only he can pass through.
Thankfully somewhere in the maze there is also a bright spike. The angel can use it to disable the fiendish field and exit to heaven's freedom.

## How to play

The angel is controlled with swipes, and, in GL mode, the control buttons at the edges of the screen.

 **Swipe** | Button | **to move** 
 :-------------------:|:---:|:-----:
 from left to right | > | right
 from right to left | < | left
 from bottom to top | ^ | up
 from top to bottom | v | down
 Single tap | . | halt
 

If your phone supports it, it is also possible to move using gravity.
To play with gravity it must be enabled in the start screen.
Touch Gravity to turn it green and then in the game slide the phone as you would to let gravity pull you.
If you play the game on a tablet you may need to turn on Gravity Swap, as some tablets gravity sensors are inverted.
The angel will be able to collect stars in the maze to increase the score.

## Display modes

There are various display modes.
Plain mode shows the complete map  in a simple way.
3d mode has a little more perspective but still displays the whole map.
GL mode used openGL for the rendering and follows the player
3rd person mode moves the camera behind the player and modifies the controls so that

## Network mode

With two phones in the same wi-fi network a player can take the part of the devil to play a chase game.
Connect to a local Wi-Fi network before using the network mode.

In this mode the devil is able to pickup the stars hammer and spike, however passing through his demonic field will destroy it so the angel can escape.
The angel wins by escaping, the devil by catching the angel.
